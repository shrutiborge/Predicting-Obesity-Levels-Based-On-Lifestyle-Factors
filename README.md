# Predicting-Obesity-Levels-Based-On-Lifestyle-Factors
This project aims to predict obesity levels in individuals using machine learning models. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and includes information on eating habits, physical condition, and demographic factors of individuals from various countries.


 Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

• Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. 

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of obesity levels and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features for model training.

• Model Selection and Training: Evaluating and training different machine learning models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict obesity levels.

• Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

• Conclusion: Selecting the best-performing model and summarizing the findings.


Key Findings

• The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy (94.3%) and was chosen as the most suitable model for predicting obesity levels.

• Random Forest also performed well (95.7% accuracy) but was considered less preferable due to its complexity and longer training time.

• The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting obesity levels based on individual characteristics and behaviors.
